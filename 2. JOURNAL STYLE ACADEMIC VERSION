Abstract

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and autonomous systems has created unprecedented strain on global infrastructure, including energy systems, data centers, smart cities, and cyber-physical networks. Current AI architectures are optimized for prediction and content generation but lack the ability to govern large-scale, safety-critical, and energy-constrained systems. This paper introduces QUENNE v2.0 (Quantum Edge Neuromorphic Engine), a multi-layer cognitive infrastructure that integrates quantum-inspired optimization, neuromorphic control, and multi-agent governance into a unified cyber-physical control fabric. QUENNE enables real-time coordination of computation, energy, security, and physical infrastructure, providing a scalable foundation for intelligent civilization-scale systems.

1. Introduction

Modern infrastructure is increasingly controlled by software, yet its underlying intelligence remains fragmented across independent systems. Data centers optimize compute, power grids optimize electricity, and AI models optimize predictions—without a unifying intelligence layer capable of coordinating all three. This fragmentation creates instability, inefficiency, and growing systemic risk.

QUENNE v2.0 addresses this gap by introducing a cognitive fabric capable of governing both digital and physical systems as a unified whole.

2. Related Work

Relevant research domains include:
   •   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
   •   Hierarchical Control Theory
   •   Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
   •   Neuromorphic and Event-Driven Computing
   •   Quantum-Inspired Optimization

While each domain has matured independently, no existing architecture integrates them into a single operational fabric for global-scale intelligent infrastructure. QUENNE v2.0 is designed to bridge this gap.

3. System Overview

QUENNE v2.0 is a distributed, multi-layer control architecture composed of:
	1.	Sensor & Telemetry Layer – continuous observation of physical and digital states
	2.	Neuromorphic Control Layer – fast event-driven stabilization
	3.	Quantum-Inspired Optimization Layer – global scheduling and resource allocation
	4.	Multi-Agent Governance Layer – high-level arbitration and resilience

These layers form a closed-loop cyber-physical control system.

4. Neuromorphic Real-Time Control

The neuromorphic layer employs event-driven computation and spiking neural networks to provide:
   •   ultra-low latency response
   •   energy-efficient monitoring
   •   anomaly detection
   •   predictive maintenance

This enables QUENNE to react in milliseconds to thermal, electrical, and cyber events.

5. Quantum-Inspired Optimization

Global decisions such as workload placement, energy dispatch, and network routing are solved using quantum-inspired optimization methods including:
   •   annealing
   •   Ising-model formulations
   •   probabilistic solvers

These allow QUENNE to solve combinatorial resource allocation problems beyond classical heuristics.

6. Multi-Agent Governance (TRIAD)

QUENNE v2.0 employs a triadic multi-agent structure:
   •   Michael – supervisory governance
   •   Gabriel – resilience and security
   •   Rafael – global optimization

Together, these agents arbitrate decisions, resolve conflicts, and maintain system stability.

7. Platform Ecosystem

QUENNE v2.0 serves as the cognitive fabric for:
   •   QUENNE AI
   •   QUENNE LLM
   •   QUENNE AI OS
   •   QUENNE AI Server OS
   •   QUENNE Smart City

It can also power and govern external AI, cloud, and infrastructure systems.

8. Security and Resilience

QUENNE integrates:
   •   cyber-physical anomaly detection
   •   adversarial pattern recognition
   •   self-healing control loops
   •   distributed fail-safe operation

This makes it suitable for safety-critical and hostile environments.
